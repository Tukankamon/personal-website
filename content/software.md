## Software that I use on a daily basis, will be marked as unfree if that is the case
### Operating system (Linux ofc):
- [NixOs](https://nixos.org/)
    - This includes [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)

### Terminal
- I mostly use [Foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) (Wayland only) since it is what feels snappiest but Kitty is also good
- For the shell I use [Fish](https://fishshell.com/), just comes ready out of the box no tweaking needed. Only down side is it is not posix compliant and doesnt have some bashisms like running a curled script with the <() syntax so don't use it for scripting

### Window Manager
- I like [Niri](https://github.com/niri-wm/niri) if I know I will be working with terminals, opening and closing them a lot
- [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) is fine to just chill and just works

### Text Editor
- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim.github.io/) configured through [NVF](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nvf) with nix
    - You can find my dotfiles on my github in the [about](/about) page
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (Unfree) is nice to take notes in but I am trying to move away from it since it is not free software

### File Browser
- Alternate between [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) and [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) (yazi is nice since it comes bateries included, lf is more minimal)
- Nautilus from Gnome is a pretty nice GUI

### Web Browser
- [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) for most usual broswing (breakes some sites with maps)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download/) Since it is not as strict as LibreWolf
- [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) For actual privacy
- Extensions:
    - [Ublock](https://ublockorigin.com/) Must have ad blocker
    - [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) Allows vim keys in any browser so you dont have to use qtbrowser

### Misc
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) waaaaaay better cd. Feels like a caveman to go back
